# Call Tracker App Installation Guide

This guide will help you install the Call Tracker App on your computer using a provided zip file. No technical knowledge is requiredâ€”just follow the steps below.

## 1. Download and Extract the Zip File
1. Download the zip file containing the Call Tracker App to your computer.
2. Right-click the zip file and select **Extract All...**
3. Choose a location on your computer (such as your Desktop or Documents folder) and click **Extract**.
4. After extraction, you will see a new folder (for example, `CallTracker` or similar).

## 2. Run the Application
1. Open the extracted folder.
2. Find the file named **call-tracker.exe** (it may just show as "call-tracker" if file extensions are hidden).
3. Double-click **call-tracker.exe** to start the app.
   - The first time you run the app, it will create a folder named **data** inside the same folder as the app. This is where your information is stored.

## 3. Migrating Your Existing Tally Data
If you have an old tally data file (usually named `tally_data.json`):

1. Make sure the app is **closed** before proceeding.
2. Locate your old `tally_data.json` file on your computer.
3. Copy your old `tally_data.json` file.
4. Open the **data** folder inside the Call Tracker App folder (where you extracted the zip file).
5. Paste your old `tally_data.json` file into the **data** folder.
   - If asked to replace the existing file, choose **Replace** or **Yes**.
6. When you next open the app, your previous tally data will be available.

## 4. Notes
- Do **not** move or rename files inside the app folder unless instructed.
